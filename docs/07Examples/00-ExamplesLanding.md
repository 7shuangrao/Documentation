## New EMG Projects and Tutorials

We added all-new tutorials for facial, ocular, and limb EMG, as well as expanded our [ECG](https://docs.openbci.com/docs/01GettingStarted/02-Biosensing-Setups/ECGSetup) and stand-alone [EMG](https://docs.openbci.com/docs/01GettingStarted/02-Biosensing-Setups/EMGSetup) tutorials! OpenBCI documentation is meant to be an actionable jumping-off point for your BCI and bio-sensing exploration.  We look forward to seeing what you create!
