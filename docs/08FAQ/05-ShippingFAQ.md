## What are the shipping rates?

Shipping is calculated based on a number of factors including the size of the package, the postage carrier selected, and the destination. Shipping charges and delivery methods are shown at checkout. Note that shipping charges shown at checkout do not include unforeseen delivery costs such as import duty and customs taxes.

## Are duties and customs included in the shipping rate?

Countries outside the United States may be subject to import duties and customs taxes per the laws of your country of residence. As the customer, you are responsible for these charges.

We will not intervene with customs procedures, per the import laws of your country of residence.

Please be advised that product prices do not include customs fees, import taxes, brokerage fees, or any customs clearance fees. This is the responsibility of the customer.

If shipping to Europe, please expect the import tax to be about 25% of the product price. If shipping to other countries, it is about 10-20%.
