What is HEGduino and Why Use It?
First, we need a simplified lesson in human physiology to understand what this project is about. This won’t take long.


That's not simple...

Your brain is made up of several systems. Those systems are delegated by the different structures in your brain, the most pronounced and recognizable being your outer neo-cortex. The neo-cortex is divided into lobes which provide different types of processing, and those lobes are further divided into columnar "tectonics," (bundles of neuronal columns or capsules) that perform fairly specific functions (e.g., language processing, audio processing, visuo-spatial processing, and empathy to name the major ones). These columns are highly cross-wired through the neo-cortex while they all feed back into the inner brain. The inner brain is responsible for a lot of routing between lobes as well as more primal baseline and survival processes, like running your organs and generating emergency-response instincts. Your frontal lobe, for instance, contains inhibitory connections to the amygdala which strengthen with age and experience to allow for more learned versus emergency responses. The neo-cortex accounts for 80% of your brain mass and uses 30%-40% of your body’s overall energy. Human neo-cortexes are among the largest in proportion to the body among mammals. It is safe to say that the general health and stimulation of this organ is an important yet poorly articulated facet of human health.

Many of your hard-wired internal response networks have specific pathways to different tectonics in the neo-cortex (see above DTI image), and it turns out we can begin to address many of the issues associated directly through biofeedback. Blood flow is essential for haemodynamic response in the brain, where active metabolism and therefore neural activity in brain regions are 90% correlated with oxygenated blood supply, due to many of these cells not having internal storage capacity. There are countless capillaries winding themselves around all of your brain cells, supplying energy as-anticipated to all parts of very long and extremely dense networks of astrocytes, glia, neurons, etc.

Your brain cells begin to die within five minutes of aspyhxiation, and they need a constant and adaptive blood supply to make their complex networks fire properly as well as stay alive and grow or repair themselves in a sensitive cellular ecosystem. One major neurological symptom discovered and articulated in recent years is something called "hypofrontality." While once thought to be a side effect of medications or the result of severe neuro-degeneration, it turns out hypofrontality is a unanimous stress response in humans, where up to 90% of the blood flow in the frontal lobe can be restricted in response to physical or mental stress. These are some very important developments in medicine and for health education in general.


Hemoencephalography: A non-invasive biofeedback method
Hemo-encephal-ography (HEG) biofeedback is a non-invasive biofeedback method comparable to EEG neurofeedback. Originally developed in the 90’s by Hershel Toomim and Robert Marsh, HEG employs simple red/infrared blood-oxygen detection to the brain (derived from Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS)), allowing humans to easily read average blood-oxygen levels through the skull. From this information, the user is then able to assume control of their brain’s blood flow within minutes and perform what have been coined "brain pushups." Original research with the HEG even revealed candidate locations where some of the major wiring for the amygdala meets the neo-cortex may be, by finding that individuals responded even better to different biofeedback exercises that targeted associated areas of the neo-cortex. Concussion patients responded well to memory exercises paired with biofeedback, children and teens with ADHD also responded well to attention exercises paired with biofeedback, addiction patients gained more self control (see below SPECT image), and patients with migraines, depression, autism, and even schizophrenia found benefit as well. Even more, the average person is able to learn how to use the HEG in about five or ten minutes during the first session, whereas EEG-based biofeedback can take dozens of sessions over the course of months to see a benefit. In spite of clinical success, this device is still poorly recognized by the public or by health professionals.

Combining HEG Biofeedback with ‘Brain Pushups’
Enter HEGduino. This project was inspired by developments in HEG and brain science, and a desire to increase access and awareness about the benefits of HEG. Not enough people are exposed to this information and the devices themselves are prohibitively expensive. Current HEG solutions cost up to $1,000 or more and are fairly bulky. The software is lacking good front-end tools to provide more engaging experiences to newer generations.

We are solving the accessibility issue with free mobile apps and programs, with free information targeting general use (e.g., in school or for professionals between duties), and solving the price issue by encouraging open source participation, and using up-to-date parts (soon to be even cheaper with the rapidly improving and miniaturizing tech on the market). This will allow you to take the HEG anywhere, have it last a long time, and use your data to better your own health. It will let you tinker, too, for all you budding brain scientists. Devices like this support the future of health education and research.
