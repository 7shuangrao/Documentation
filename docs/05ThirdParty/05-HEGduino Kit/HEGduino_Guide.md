### Your Data, Now

The makers of HEGduino are solving the accessibility issue with free mobile apps and programs, with free information targeting general use (e.g., in school or for professionals between duties), and solving the price issue by encouraging open source participation, and using up-to-date parts (soon to be even cheaper with the rapidly improving and miniaturizing tech on the market). This will allow you to take the HEG anywhere, have it last a long time, and use your data to better your own health. Devices like this support the future of health education and research.
