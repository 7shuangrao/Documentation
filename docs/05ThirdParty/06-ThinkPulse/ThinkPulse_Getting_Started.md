## About Conscious Labs

Conscious Labs has been working since 2014 on taking neuroscience out of the lab and into the wild. They bring the technology, the team and the expertise to integrate EEG sensors into head wearables and hearables.

We are very excited to partner with Conscious Labs to offer this affordable, high-quality biosensing kit to our community. The ThinkPulse™ kit offers research-grade dry AND active electrode EEG sensors at an unprecedented price point and comfort level.

ThinkPulse™ is a product of Conscious Labs (France). Patents issued and pending. Made in France.

The ThinkPulse™ system is an *add-on* to the [Ultracortex EEG Headset](https://shop.openbci.com/collections/frontpage/products/ultracortex-mark-iv) plus [Cyton Board](https://shop.openbci.com/collections/frontpage/products/cyton-biosensing-board-8-channel)
This kit has been designed and its compatibility tested for the 8 channel Ultracortex with OpenBCI Cyton board only. Compatibility with the Ultracortex 16-channel and CytonDaisy is not currently available but we hope to have an update for you soon. For more compatibility and customization options as well as general product questions, please contact us support@openbci.com.

## How to Use the ThinkPulse Starter Kit with the Ultracortex Headset
Below is the step-by-step tutorial by Conscious Labs on how to install the ThinkPulse Starter Kit on the Ultracortex. If you are doing this for the first time, allow yourself 20 minutes to put it together. You will briefly need a soldering iron and soldering wire at Step 3. If you do not have a soldering iron, you can still assemble the ThinkPulse! Keep reading for the solder-free option.

### Step 1: Prep Your Ultracortex Mark IV EEG Headset

### Step 3: Assemble the ThinkPulse™ Power Supply Board

The assembly video shows how to install the power supply board to a post-2018 Cyton and a pre-2018 Cyton.

If you have a newer Cyton (purchased after 2018), you just need a pair of pliers, no soldering iron needed!
