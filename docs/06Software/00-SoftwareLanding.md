## OpenBCI Software

This section details the various OpenBCI-specific software and SDKs. Included here are guides on how to use the OpenBCI GUI, as well as information about developing for OpenBCI with common languages like Python, Java, Node.js, and more!

 * [The OpenBCI GUI](06Software/01-OpenBCISoftware/01-OpenBCI_GUI.md)
 * [GUI Widget Guide](06Software/01-OpenBCISoftware/02_GUI_Widget_Guide.md)
 * [Python and OpenBCI](06Software/01-OpenBCISoftware/05-OpenBCI_Python.md)
 * [OpenBCI Hub](06Software/01-OpenBCISoftware/07-OpenBCI_Hub.md)

## Compatible Third Party Software

Regarding third party software, the Cyton board is compatible with:

 * [Matlab](06Software/02-CompatibleThirdPartySoftware/01-Matlab.md)
 * [Neuromore](06Software/02-CompatibleThirdPartySoftware/02-Neuromore.md) (Bio-data acquisition, processing and visualization software)
 * [OpenViBE](06Software/02-CompatibleThirdPartySoftware/03-OpenViBE.md)
 * [LSL](06Software/02-CompatibleThirdPartySoftware/04-LSL.md)
 * [BrainBay](06Software/02-CompatibleThirdPartySoftware/05-BrainBay.md) (Open-source neurofeedback application, OpenBCI tutorial [here](https://sites.google.com/site/biofeedbackpages/brainbay-openbci) and another [here](http://www.autodidacts.io/use-openbci-with-brainbay-on-ubuntu-linux-and-wine/))
 * [BioEra](06Software/02-CompatibleThirdPartySoftware/06-BioEra.md) (Visual designer useful for analyzing signals in real time)

 The Ganglion board is currently compatible with:

 * [BioEra](http://www.proatech.com/be/manual.html#_Toc477624700)
 * [BrainBay](http://www.shifz.org/brainbay/) (Open-source neurofeedback application)

 Currently new drivers are being developed to add OpenBCI compatibility to Bioexplorer (tbd), BCI2000 (tbd), etc.

 In addition, if you are really comfortable with programming you can use [MatLab](06Software/02-CompatibleThirdPartySoftware/01-Matlab.md) or [Python](06Software/01-OpenBCISoftware/05-OpenBCI_Python.md) tools to analyze the raw data of your OpenBCI boards.
