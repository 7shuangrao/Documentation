title: Send Focus Data from GUI to Arduino
---
**Starting with GUI v5.0.0, this feature is temporarily deprecated until a more reliable and research-based Focus algorithm is implemented. If you would still like to use this widget, you can download and run [GUI v4.2.0](https://github.com/OpenBCI/OpenBCI_GUI/releases/tag/v4.2.0).**

This tutorial shows you how to get started streaming data from the OpenBCI_GUI's Focus Widget via Serial connection to an [Arduino UNO Rev3](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/arduino-uno-rev3).
Head [**HERE**](https://www.instructables.com/id/Send-Focus-Data-From-OpenBCI-GUI-to-Arduino/) to find the OpenBCI/Arduino Focus Data tutorial in the updated Instructable format!

## What do I need?

-   The [OpenBCI_GUI](https://github.com/OpenBCI/OpenBCI_GUI/releases/latest) standalone app or Processing sketch
-   An [Arduino UNO](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/arduino-uno-rev3), or other similar device
-   An [OpenBCI Board](https://shop.openbci.com/collections/frontpage) _(Optional)_

## Helpful Background Skills

-   [Arduino Basics](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/HomePage)
-   Knowledge of [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/reference/en/) or C-based programming
-   Experience running the OpenBCI GUI [from the Processing IDE](Software/01-OpenBCISoftware/01-OpenBCI_GUI.md) _(Optional)_

### Step 1 - Load the Example in the Arduino IDE

The [OpenBCI_GUI-FocusArduino.ino](https://github.com/OpenBCI/Documentation/blob/master/OpenBCI_files/OpenBCI_GUI-FocusArduino/OpenBCI_GUI-FocusArduino.ino) file is designed to serve as a simple starting point for creating your own Arduino project using data from the GUI over serial.

You can copy/paste the code from Github into the Arduino IDE or [download the Docs](https://github.com/OpenBCI/Documentation/archive/master.zip) and navigate to the example `/OpenBCI_files/OpenBCI_GUI-FocusArduino/OpenBCI_GUI-FocusArduino.ino`.

### Step 2 - Upload the Arduino sketch

After uploading the sketch, you can close or minimize the Arduino IDE, but keep the Arduino connected to the computer. The sketch we just uploaded is running!

### Step 3 - Open OpenBCI_GUI in Synthetic Mode

### Step 4 - Start Streaming

#### Open and Setup the Networking Widget

#### Open the Focus Widget. Then, click "Start Data Stream" and then "Start" in the Networking Widget

#### Next, turn off channel one to simulate Focused state.

The Arduino's built-in LED should blink when the Focus Widget reads "focused!"

How does the Focus Widget work? [Check out this community post!](https://openbci.com/community/focus-visualization-widget/)

How can this be used to _make_ something? [Here's an example!](https://openbci.com/community/using-openbci-guis-focus-widget-to-harness-alpha-and-beta-waves/)

### Step 5 - Learn! Create! Share!

From here, you can add more to your new Arduino project to react to Focus data from the OpenBCI_GUI:

-   Use Live Data from a [Cyton](https://shop.openbci.com/collections/frontpage/products/cyton-biosensing-board-8-channel?variant=38958638542) or [Ganglion](https://shop.openbci.com/collections/frontpage/products/ganglion-board)

-   Try controlling even more LEDs using the Arduino

-   Try controlling a motor or group of motors

-   Make a second copy of your project and make it a two player game!
